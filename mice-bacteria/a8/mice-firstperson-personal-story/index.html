            <p>My hands shook as I looked at the ash that was my 5-year-old&#x27;s daughter’s bedroom… </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>It was 6am, as my husband and I stood in the charred ruins of what used to be her bed. &quot;We nearly lost her”, my husband sobbed. “But the hospital says she’ll be home soon”. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>“The insurance company also said it will cost us $27,000 to fix the damage”.  </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>My mind raced back to our daughter’s burns, her crying face, and her <em>terrified screams</em>, as we fled from our home into the street. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>&quot;It can’t happen again&quot;, I’d told myself. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>“The signs were there from the start”. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>That’s because, for four painful months, I had watched as our house turned into ground zero. <strong>After mice took over our home. </strong>In every room. Plus, our car, roof, under the floors, garage, and behind our walls. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Turns out, for every mouse you see, there are 10-12 more hidden close by.  </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>In short… </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>I had become the &quot;mice-infested home&quot; nobody wanted to visit.</strong></p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>The mice would also gnaw through things. Such as our sofas, armchairs, and TV wires. Which cost us thousands to replace.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>As well as priceless sentimental items. Such as our books, artwork, and photographs. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Tip: a mouse’s teeth never stop growing. Which is why they’re always on the look out for something new to bite on.  </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Every morning, we’d also wake up to new droppings, dander, and urine stains. All over our home. Or dead mice in our cereal. After they ate through the box. Or in other places. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Later, when my daughter had an allergic reaction to the mice (a problem that affects 3.5 million Americans — including 50% of kids!), with coughing and wheezing, a fever, watery-red eyes, a rash, and a tight chest, I rushed her to the hospital.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>At one point, she even struggled to breathe.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>As a mom, it was a nightmare.</strong></p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Even if I was just as scared by the diseases mice can give you. Such as leptospirosis, salmonella, tularemia, tapeworms, or hantavirus. That has a kill rate of 38% in people<sup>1</sup>.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>So, I guess we got lucky. Even if the medical bill was huge. At several hundred dollars. But… </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>…with the mice in our home, our daughter would always be at risk.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>I tried everything to get rid of them: </strong></p>

              <li><strong>✖️ Professional Exterminators —</strong> who can charge you up to $8,000. For only one treatment<sup>2</sup> (if one is enough), and could also force you to take time off of work, or fill your home with nasty chemicals. Hint: if you’ve suffered from redness, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, nausea, belly issues, headaches, dizziness, throat irritation, nasal congestion, or rashes, it could be because of these toxins.</li>
              <li><strong>✖️ Mouse Traps —</strong> Which demand constant maintenance. Plus, the nonstop cleanup of dead bodies. Like an endless game of whack-a-mole. Where only one mouse is caught at a time. Which leaves the other mice free to breed. Plus, have you ever caught your finger in one? — Ow! Those things are strong enough to break a small dog’s leg.</li>
              <li><strong>✖️ Poison Baits —</strong> Which aren’t only a risk to your pet. If your pet (or your neighbor’s / friends’ little fur baby) eats it directly. Or if it eats a mouse that’s been killed by one. They also look like something a child would LOVE to play with. With bright colors. Kind of like candy. And (again), it could scatter dead mice all over your home. Once they eat the poison, and crawl away to die. Into those hard to reach places. For you to clean up. Or to rot. With a stink that lasts for life…</li>

            <p>I was even afraid to eat the food we had at home. In case it made us sick. Or there was a horrid surprise in it. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>I became <strong>anxious</strong>, <strong>stressed</strong>, and <strong>withdrawn. </strong>To the point I was always waiting for the next shoe to drop. When something else would be damaged or ruined…</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>One morning I even found mice under the hood of our car. So I avoided driving too. In case there was a fault. Caused by the mice’s chewing. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>My husband and I would fight too. Since we were so worn down. It was honestly the lowest point of our relationship. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>That’s why, that night, after picking (more!) droppings out of my daughter’s favorite pancake mix, I made a decision. I refused to let these vermin destroy our lives. </p>

            <p>Her blanket caught fire. She screamed. Our smoke alarm went off. We rushed in. Saved her. Fled our home. Then called 9/11.  </p>

            <p>&quot;Sarah, I need to tell you something,&quot; she’d confided.</p>

            <p>&quot;Two years ago, my house was just like yours. Mice everywhere, chewed wires, spoiled food, it was awful”.  </p>

            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Carol told me how Gary, a professional exterminator from Miami, with 20+ years of experience and 20,000+ successful treatments, had helped tens of thousands of Americans to win their war vs. mice. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>&quot;The first thing Gary told me,&quot; Carol said, &quot;was a big reason you’ve failed to get rid of your mice up to now is because most so-called “solutions” CANNOT keep mice away for good.” </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>“In short: it is NOT your fault”. </p>
            <p>‍</p>

          <p><strong>Fact #3: </strong>A Kansas State University study on ultrasonic devices found only weak results vs. mice. With less than 20% repellency in labs, and worse results in real-world settings. Where obstacles blocked the devices&#x27; sound, and other noises competed. What&#x27;s more, success was short-lived. As mice soon got used to it. Like living next to a railway track. At first, the noise was a jolt. But, soon, it fades into the background<sup>12</sup>.</p>

        <div class="favt-block">
          <p><strong>Fact #4: </strong>A mouse’s teeth are also stronger than iron<sup>13</sup>. Thanks to a special metal-rich enamel on their incisors. Which is how they can chew through water pipes. To flood your home. In the middle of the night.</p>

            <p><strong>Ingredient #1 - Corn Mint </strong></p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Which sets off a panic response in the AmPir part of the mouse’s brain<sup>14</sup>. Like what happens if a mouse smells the urine of a predator… </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>This then forces the mouse to run away. On a biological level. Thanks to the automatic release of panic hormones. Such as corticosterone.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Better yet, because this response is hardwired into a mouse’s DNA...<sup>1516</sup> after 13 million years of evolution… it also means mice are unable to adapt…  No matter how much they’re exposed to it<sup>17</sup>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>In short, they will always be afraid. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Plus, it irritates their nasal passage. Like if you snort hot peppers. Which isn’t <em>essential</em>. But it is nice to have. </p>

            <p><strong>Ingredient #2 - Citronella Oil</strong></p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Which overwhelms a mouse’s sense of smell. To confuse and “blind” them to their surroundings. Which sabotages their ability to navigate… </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>It’s like walking through a thick cloud of smoke, with a gag, a noseplug, and noise-proof headphones. Which is obviously something you’d want to avoid. Especially if there were huge (human) giants walking around. With feet that could crush you. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Tip: this is also highly effective. Because mice rely so much on their sense of smell. E.g. mice have 1,400+ different genes for smell. But only 347 for sight. </p>

            <p>Which has no direct effect on mice. Instead, it cranks up the power of the citronella and corn mint to 1,000!!!! To act as a multiplier. Which it does by trapping the other ingredients inside of it… </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>After which, it releases them slowly. Which allows the molecules inside of these oils to stick around. For longer<sup>18</sup>. Before they fade away naturally. For better long-term protection. </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>It also helps the corn mint and citronella to stick to surfaces better. For a more consistent “shield”. </p>

As soon as you place your <a href="https://trk.bugmd.com/preclick">Vamoose™</a> pouch, all three ingredients hit the mice like a freight train. The corn mint triggers their hardwired fear response. The citronella oil overwhelms their senses and blinds them to their surroundings. And the linseed oil cranks up the power of both ingredients to 1,000! The mice feel queasy, confused, and terrified. They start to flee immediately.</p>
