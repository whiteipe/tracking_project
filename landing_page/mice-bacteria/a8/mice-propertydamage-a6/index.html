              <p><strong>The real reason you can’t get rid of your mice might shock you</strong></p>
              <p>As it could save your life… </p>
              <p>It’s also the #1 reason mice populations have soared. By 500%<sup>1</sup>. In the US<sup>2</sup>. In recent years<sup>3</sup>. According to studies from the University of Nebraska<sup>4</sup>. Which points to a level of negligence that ought to shock you… </p>
              <p>And all as the $22.6 billion big pest control industry makes record profits<sup>5</sup>. With billions in indirect government subsidies<sup>6</sup>. Plus, tens of millions in bonuses for company executives<sup>7</sup>.</p>
              <p>But, why?  </p>
              <p>That’s when I stumbled on the groundbreaking work of Dr. Bobby Corrigan. Whose research has now been adopted by international experts.     </p>
              <p>Thanks to the discovery of a 30-second trick. Including 1 ingredient you could have in your kitchen right now. That gets rid of mice for good. So they won’t come back. </p>
              <p>Better yet, there are no toxic chemicals, overpriced exterminators, or poisons that can make you, your pet, or your loved ones sick. </p>
              <p>Or ugly traps. That everyone will notice. Which could snap your toe. Or require a lot of messy clean-up and maintenance. Like an endless game of whack-a-mole… </p>
              <p>So, what is it?</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="title"><strong>Dr. Bobby Corrigan’s Breakthrough—And the Shocking Truth About How to Get Rid of Mice </strong></h2>

            <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
              <p>Dr. Bobby isn&#x27;t just another scientist—he’s a giant in mice research. As one of the world’s leading experts in rodentology. Who specializes in mice behavior and pest management. Which has led him to become a top advisor to major US municipalities (e.g. New York and Boston) and numerous companies. </p>
              <p>He’s also authored 160+ articles, 4+ text books, and delivered 100+ invited seminars, in 12+ countries, and 45+ states.</p>
              <p>In fact, he’s so well known as an expert, scientists refer to him by his first name. As “Dr. Bobby”. </p>
              <p>But, as I explored his research, a single sentence got stuck in my mind:   </p>
              <p><em>“Leading experts now know 74-92% of mice are not eradicated by conventional treatments<sup>8.9.10</sup>. Instead, a common spice does far better. In fact, it stops mice from ever entering your home. So they stay out for good”. </em></p>
              <p>This wasn’t just theory — it was a scientific fact.</p>
              <p>And yet, almost no one spoke about it. </p>
              <p>Which means, since 2024, millions of Americans have been needlessly tortured by mice. That will chew through your furniture, shoes, electronics, and more. <em>Which may never work again.</em> After a mouse eats into your wires…</p>
              <p>Tip #1: 1-in-5 US house fires start this way. </p>
              <p>Which can also cost you $1,200 to fix. Per incident. On average. Here in the US. Plus… </p>
              <p>…your priceless sentimental items. Such as books, artwork, or photographs. That cannot be replaced. Once they’re ruined. </p>
              <p>And your vehicle. Which may never run again. Or have a dangerous fault on the road. After mice get into it. Attracted by the warmth. </p>
              <p>Tip #2: a mouse’s teeth never stop growing. Which is why they’re always on the look out for something to bite on. </p>
              <p>This is also why a mice problem can cut the value of your home. By a HUGE $36,000-$72,000<sup>11</sup>. On average<sup>12</sup>. If it’s seen by a would-be buyer. </p>
              <p>Especially as, for every mouse you see, there are usually 10-12 more hidden close by. </p>
              <p>This is also why you MUST respond right away. If you see a mouse nearby. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="rich-text quote w-richtext">
              <p><strong>FACT #1: </strong>32-48 million US households are now invaded by mice every year.</p>

              <p>Then I saw the most chilling part:</p>

            <h2 class="title top-space"><strong>Why Popular Mice Treatments Ignore 74-92% of Mice — So They Always Come Back!  </strong></h2>

            <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
              <p>Because what most pest control “experts” don&#x27;t tell you is that many anti-mice treatments CANNOT keep mice away for good. </p>
              <p>E.g. They’ll kill <em>some </em>mice. But leave the rest free to breed. Or let new mice into your home. From outside. Which means your mice problem will always come back…  </p>
              <p>Which makes them basically useless. As they’ll only delay your problem. Instead of fixing it. </p>
              <p>In fact, it was Dr. Bobby who exposed this weakness<sup>13</sup>.</p>
              <p>Which is great for the companies who sell you this stuff. But bad for you…</p>
              <p>Since you’ll waste your cash on a short-term fix. Vs. a real long-term solution. Again and again…</p>
              <p>Especially as all it takes is one pair of mice to go from 2 to 2,000 in under a year<sup>14</sup>. </p>
              <p>It’s like throwing water out of a sinking ship. Without ever plugging the leak that lets water in in the first place. Pointless. Unless you fix the root cause of your problem. </p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="title"><strong>This Means, Even If You Try To Defend Yourself From Mice, They’ll Always Come Back  </strong></h2>

            <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
              <p>Dr. Bobby’s work also led me to find out that mice have developed a resistance to many traditional rodenticides<sup>15</sup>.</p>
              <p>Such as brodifacoum, difethialone, flocoumafen, and bromadiolone. Which many mice are now 74-85% resistant to. Up from only 10% in the recent past<sup>16</sup>. Which is an 8-fold increase!</p>
              <p>All thanks to short-term evolutionary pressure. That has made these mice “immune” to such chemicals. </p>
              <p>Although a lot of pest control companies still use them…</p>
              <p>Mostly out of habit.  </p>
              <p>A fact that has contributed to a 5x increase in the total number of mice. Here in the US. Over the last few years.</p>
              <p>Worse… </p>

            <h2 class="title"><strong>Why Traditional Mice Treatments Don’t Work</strong></h2>

            <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
              <p>Many of the alternative solutions people turn to also come with a big downside.</p>
              <p><strong>Such as poisons…</strong> </p>
              <p>Which aren’t only a risk to your pet. If your pet (or your neighbor’s / friends’ little fur baby) eats it directly… </p>
              <p>…they can also hurt (or kill) your pet if they eat a mouse that’s consumed it. Second hand. Plus… </p>
              <p>…a lot of poisons also look like something a child would LOVE to play with. With bright colors. Just like candy. And… </p>
              <p>…it could scatter dead rats and mice all over your home…</p>
              <p>…after they eat the poison, then crawl away to die. Into those hard to reach places. For you to clean up. Or to rot. With a stink that lasts for months…</p>
              <p>Say goodbye to your social life! </p>
              <p><strong>Then there’s mouse traps… </strong></p>
              <p>...which require constant maintenance. Plus, the nonstop messy cleanup of dead bodies. One after the other. Like an endless game of whack-a-mole…  </p>
              <p>…where only one mouse is caught at a time. Which leaves the others free to breed, feed, and to damage your home. E.g. sticky traps that only catch 8% of mice.</p>
              <p>(After all, if you released one, it would come back right away).</p>
              <p>All as the corpse, that’s left in your trap, rots and smells…  </p>
              <p>Or, an injured rat or mouse squeaks out in pain. ‘til they die. Which could be hard to ignore. </p>
              <p>Plus, have you ever caught your finger in one? — Ow!</p>
              <p>After all, many traps are strong enough to break your finger. Or a pet’s paw. Which makes them a big risk.</p>
              <p>Lastly there’s…</p>
              <p><strong>Option 3. An exterminator.</strong></p>
              <p>Which can be a huge rip off…</p>
              <p>As they can cost you anything from $200 (for a short inspection) to $8,000 (for a treatment). With additional follow-up costs of $150. Every month. Which can raise your cost (again!), by hundreds of dollars more…  </p>
              <p>Not to mention the hassle of monitoring them… With a day off work... As they trudge through your home... Or break things?</p>
              <p>Plus, the risk of them coating your home in a toxic residue…</p>
              <p>Hint: if you’ve suffered from redness, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, nausea, belly issues, watery eyes, headaches, dizziness, throat irritation, nasal congestion, and rashes, it may be because of these chemicals.</p>
              <p>Most of which also only works short term. Which means…</p>
              <p>…in only a few short weeks… </p>
              <p>…you’ll probably have to call the exterminator. Again. For another expensive treatment. </p>
              <p>Which put me between a rock and a hard place. When my own home was invaded by mice. Before I discovered Dr. Bobby’s research. </p>
              <p>All because I felt the “cure” could be worse than the disease.<br></p>

            <div class="rich-text chatbox w-richtext">
              <p>✖️ <strong> Ultra-sonic Repellents —</strong> which did nothing, as the mice would quickly get used to it. After an initial jolt. Like living next to a railway track… </p>
              <p>✖️ <strong>A Cat — </strong>since they can’t catch the numbers required to make a dent in a mouse population. Especially if the mice can hide in places (e.g. walls) where a cat can’t get to. Or…</p>
              <p>✖️ <strong> Blocking the Mice’s Entry Holes — </strong>throughout my home. Up to 1/4 inch (about 6 mm) wide. Such as with caulk and steel wool. Which didn’t help. As they mice would soon find or make another way in. </p>
              <p>— useless! </p>
            </div>
            <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
              <p>Luckily… </p>

              <p>After a follow-up study from Cornell University<sup>20</sup>. </p>
              <p>That can: <br></p>

            <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
              <p><strong>1. Repel Mice 24/7 Like a Forcefield</strong> — so they won’t enter your home. From up to 164 feet away (50 meters). Which is about the same length as an Olympic-sized pool…</p>
              <p>Or half of a US football field. Plus, it’s… </p>
              <p><strong>2. 100% Safe For Kids And Pets —</strong> because it only affects mice. When used as directed. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
              <p>In fact, this kind of pest control is now widely used in large scale agriculture<sup>21</sup>, by governments<sup>22</sup>, and in commercial pest control<sup>23</sup>. Such as in hospitals, luxury hotels, or animal shelters. Thanks to how well it works. </p>
              <p>Although it has only recently become available to the average American. </p>

            <h2 class="title"><strong>Dr. Bobby’s Inspiration: The 3 Ingredients That Changed Everything </strong></h2>
            <div class="asset-holder small-space"><img src="mice-propertydamage-a6/images/7.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1520px) 100vw, 1520px" srcset="mice-propertydamage-a6/images/7-p-500.jpg 500w, mice-propertydamage-a6/images/7-p-800.jpg 800w, mice-propertydamage-a6/images/7-p-1080.jpg 1080w, mice-propertydamage-a6/images/7.jpg 1520w" alt="" class="image-asset"></div>
            <div class="rich-text w-richtext">
              <p><strong>Ingredient #1 - Citronella Oil </strong></p>
              <p>Which overwhelms a mouse’s sense of smell. To confuse and “blind” them to their surroundings. Which sabotages their ability to navigate…  </p>
              <p>Like walking through a thick cloud of smoke, with a gag, noseplug, and noise-proof headphones. Tip: this is highly effective because mice rely so much on their sense of smell. </p>
              <p>Then there’s…</p>
              <p><strong>Ingredient #2 - Corn Mint </strong></p>
              <p>Which sets off a panic response in the AmPir part of the mouse’s brain<sup>24</sup>. Like what happens if a mouse smells the urine of a predator… while it also irritates their nasal passage…</p>
              <p>This forces a mouse to run away, Thanks to the automatic release of panic hormones. Such as corticosterone.</p>
              <p>Better yet, because this response is hardwired into a mouse’s DNA<sup>25.26</sup>, after 13 million years of evolution… this also means that mice are unable to adapt…  No matter how much they’re exposed to it<sup>27</sup>.</p>
              <p>In short, they will always be afraid. </p>
              <p>Lastly there’s… </p>
              <p><strong>Ingredient #3 - Linseed Oil </strong></p>
              <p>Which has no direct effect on mice. Instead, it cranks up the power of the citronella and corn mint to 100. To act as a multiplier. Which it does by trapping the other ingredients inside of it. Then releasing them slowly. </p>
              <p>It also helps the other ingredients to stick to surfaces better. For a more consistent “shield”. </p>
              <p>Plus…</p>
              <p>…it lets the molecules in these unique essential oils stick around for FAR longer<sup>28</sup>. As a kind of preservative. Before they fade away naturally. For better long-term protection. </p>
              <p>It can also make mice feel queasy, without killing them<sup>29</sup>. Which is another reason for them not to stick around your property.</p>
              <p>In short…</p>
              <p><strong>These 3 ingredients are like a non-stop force field that compels mice to leave your home in fear. And never return.</strong></p>
              <p>This way, they won’t be a problem for you! </p>
              <p>And all for less than the cost of a cheap cup of coffee. Per pouch. After years of peer-reviewed testing… On over 2,000+ scents, that mice can detect<sup>30</sup>. </p>
              <p>In a way that’s… </p>
              <p>Cruelty free</p>
              <p>Subtle - so nobody will know you have mice, and… </p>
              <p>In a way that fits your schedule. </p>
              <p>Which is insanely good value. Especially when you compare it to the alternatives.</p>

              <p>In a landmark study, researchers tested essential oil&#x27;s repellent effect on rodents.</p>
              <p>Different groups of rodents were exposed to various treatments.</p>
              <p>Some groups were exposed to control solutions (no essential oil treatment). While others were exposed to a <strong>natural essential oil spray</strong> at different concentrations - 5%, 10%, and 20%.</p>
              <p>Over the course of several days with daily applications, the control groups showed minimal deterrent effects with rodents maintaining normal feeding behavior.</p>
              <p><strong>But the rodents exposed to the breakthrough natural essential oil treatments?</strong></p>
              <p>They experienced dramatic behavioral changes. With average repellency rates often around or above 70-80% over several days<sup>31</sup>.</p>
              <p>It was amazing!</p>

              <p>That’s why a team of scientists quickly worked to synthesize the essential oils in these plants. To make the solution as potent as possible. For regular folk to use. In one easy-to-use spray. </p>

              <p><strong>&quot;Ignoring a Mice Problem Only Makes It Worse&quot;</strong></p>
              <p>Right now, you might notice a few droppings in your cupboard, some occasional scratching sounds, or a sighting here and there. But without the right treatment, this problem won&#x27;t just stay the same—it will explode!</p>
              <p>Think of a small leak in your roof. At first, it&#x27;s barely noticeable. But over time, it spreads. To cause more damage. Until your entire home is flooded and destroyed. Perhaps to the point of no return.</p>
              <p>That&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening with your mice problem. If you don&#x27;t act, the infestation will continue to spread—from 2 mice to 2,000 in under a year, burrowing deeper into your walls, floors, and ceiling.</p>
              <p>And once mice establish breeding colonies throughout your home, they become nearly impossible to eliminate with traditional methods.</p>
              <p>The truth is, waiting could mean the difference between a quick solution or months of expensive treatments, property damage, and sleepless nights. </p>
              <p>Or the chance you could lose your home forever.</p>
              <p>Which path do you want to take? </p>

            <div class="rich-text top-negative w-richtext">
              <p>Today I&#x27;d like you to think about what happens if you hesitate…</p>
              <p>Because the way I see it you have 2 options that lead to 2 very different outcomes.</p>
              <p>See… mice infestations are a progressive problem.</p>
              <p>This means that unless you act early, they get worse over time.</p>
              <p>Each day you wait, those 2 mice multiply into 20, then 200, then 2,000.</p>
              <p>In no time, you&#x27;re looking at a full-blown invasion of disease-carrying rodents. All over your home.</p>
              <p>The financial cost alone can be huge. With property damage that can hit $1,500-$3,000.</p>
              <p>While the cost of an exterminator could reach $8,000.</p>
              <p>Plus, all the time you’d lose. Maintaining traps. Non-stop. Forever. </p>
              <p>Or the risk you’d take. By leaving poison bait around your pets and kids. </p>
              <p>The peaceful sanctuary you knew will disappear, replaced by a contaminated nightmare you barely recognize.</p>
              <p>You can&#x27;t have guests over out of embarrassment.</p>
              <p>Your children&#x27;s friends stop coming to play.</p>
              <p>You find yourself isolated, ashamed, and desperate.</p>
              <p>Some people are even forced to do the unthinkable and sell their home at a loss.</p>
              <p>Or, in some cases, to abandon it entirely. Once the damage becomes too extensive. After the structure is weakened.</p>
              <p>In short…</p>
              <p>This isn&#x27;t just about mice. It&#x27;s about losing everything you love most.</p>
              <p>Which leads to… </p>

              <p><strong>Option #2:</strong></p>
              <p>You can make the smart decision to try Vamoose™. Which could turn things around… no matter how bad they look right now.</p>
              <p>You can finally experience the relief you&#x27;ve been desperately searching for. Within only hours of using Vamoose™, you&#x27;ll watch your home transform back into the clean, safe sanctuary you remember.</p>
              <p>No more frantic scratching in the walls. No more droppings and contamination. No more constant worry from ongoing damage.</p>
              <p>Your peaceful home will be quiet through the night – and so will you. You&#x27;ll walk into your kitchen with confidence, counters clean with genuine relief. As your sense of security and peace comes flooding back.</p>
              <p>Your home becomes a sanctuary again. You can invite friends over without shame. Your children can play freely without fear of disease. No more emergency exterminator visits. No more expensive treatments that don&#x27;t work. No more guilt</p>

              <p>OR you&#x27;ll get your money back.</p>
              <p>It&#x27;s a win-win.</p>
              <p>Either way, it&#x27;s better than just giving up and doing nothing.</p>
              <p>I still thank God every day that I discovered Vamoose™.</p>
              <p>It saved my home and my peace of mind.</p>
